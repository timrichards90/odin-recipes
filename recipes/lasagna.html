    <h3>Nonnas Style</h3>
    <p>One of the most loved foods in the world is finally here! 
        This is a traditional Italian Lasagna, made the Italian way with layers of slow cooked Bolognese ragu and cheese sauce. </p>
    <p>No ricotta – that’s the American-Italian version. Though patience is required, it is quite straight forward to make as you will see in the recipe video!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot</li>
        <li>1 stick of celery</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. 
            Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. 
            Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet - they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
        <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
        <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
        <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. 
            Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 - 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich.</li>
    </ol>
